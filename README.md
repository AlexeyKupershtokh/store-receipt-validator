PHP library that can be used to validate base64 encoded iTunes in app purchase receipts.


## Requirements ##

* PHP >= 5.3

## Getting Started ##

The easiest way to work with this package is when it's installed as a
Composer package inside your project. Composer isn't strictly
required, but makes life a lot easier.

If you're not familiar with Composer, please see <http://getcomposer.org/>.

1. Add reply-me-by-email to your application's composer.json.

        {
            ...
            "require": {
                "aporat/iap-validator": "dev-master"
            },
            ...
        }

2. Run `php composer install`.

3. If you haven't already, add the Composer autoload to your project's
   initialization file. (example)

        require 'vendor/autoload.php';


## Quick Example ##


```php


```
